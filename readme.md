## Design Choices

1. Navigation: Used React Navigation's Drawer Navigator for the main navigation structure, providing easy access to HomeScreen, CartScreen, and other potential screens.

2. State Management: Implemented Redux for global state management, particularly for handling the shopping cart across different components.

3. API Calls: Utilized Axios for fetching product data from an external API due to its ease of use and built-in request/response interceptors.

4. Local Storage: Chose AsyncStorage for persisting cart data locally, allowing users to retain their cart items between app sessions.

5. UI Components: Used React Native Paper for consistent and customizable UI elements across the app.
